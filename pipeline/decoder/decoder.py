class Decoder():
    """
    A class to decode values of template variables.

    Template variables consist of all information stored within the YAML data of entities and between curly braces.
    Similar to variables in a programming language, template variables work as placeholders for useful information
    that must be decoded before the rendering of the output files.
    Template variables allow for the reusage of entity definitions.
    There are two types of template variables:
        - the ones defined internally by the application itself;
        - the ones defined externally by developers at the configuration file level.
    User defined template variables are set using the field "vars".

    The decoding follow an hierarchical scheme, starting with the areas that contain the robotic agents.
    These are then decoded, followed by the packages and images they temselves contain.

    Entities of type "Global Image" pass inaltered through the decoding stage.
    ...
