class Image:
    """
    A class used to represent entities of both types "Image" and "Global Image".
    Each entity of type "Image" holds information about an existing Docker image that runs a ROS node and is
    associated with a robotic agent.
    Each entity of type "Global Image" holds information about an existing Docker image, that is not ROS related
    and is not associated with a particual robotic agent.

    Attributes
    ----------
    id : str
        an unique identifier for the entity.

    required_fields : list
        the required fields for an entity of this type to be considered valid.

    yaml_data : dict
        the complete YAML data for the entity obtained from the input configuration file.
